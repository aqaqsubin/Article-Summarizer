Pakistan Minority Persecution
FILE - In this Monday, July 28, 2014 file photo, Pakistani police officers examine a house of a family belonging to the Ahmadi sect, which was torched by angry mob following rumors about blasphemous postings on Facebook, in Gujranwala, Pakistan. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom on Friday, Jan. 8, 2021, adopted 55-year-old Ramazan Bibi, jailed on blasphemy charges in Pakistan, as a prisoner of conscience. According to a December report by the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedoms, Pakistan recorded the most cases of blasphemy in the world even though 84 countries have criminal blasphemy laws on their books.
