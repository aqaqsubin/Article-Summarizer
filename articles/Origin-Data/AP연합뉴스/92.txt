APTOPIX Virus Outbreak Philippines Catholic Procession
Young Catholic devotees wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus stand try to get a glimpse of the the Black Nazarene at the Santa Cruz Church in Manila, Philippines a day before it's feast day on Friday Jan. 8, 2021. The annual Jan. 9 procession attended by tens of thousands of devotees has been cancelled amid the threat of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in one of Asia's biggest religious events. Several Black Nazarene replicas have been placed around churches as the government asks devotees to pray at their communities instead of going to downtown Quiapo where the original image stays.
