Pakistan Shiite Protest
People from the Shiite Hazara community gather around coffins of coal mine workers killed by gunmen near the Machh coal field, during a sit-in to protest, in Quetta, Pakistan, Friday, Jan. 8, 2021. Pakistan's prime minister Friday appealed the protesting minority Shiites not to link the burial of 11 coal miners from Hazara community who were killed by the Islamic State group to his visit to the mourners, saying such a demand amounted to blackmailing the country's premier.
