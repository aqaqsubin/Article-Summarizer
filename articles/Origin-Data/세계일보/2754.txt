[WT논평] The U.N. hasn’t functioned as intended (2)
The U.N. has a gaggle of “special rapporteurs” who make political inquiries into whatever the U.N. assigns. Agnes Callamard, the special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, said on July 8 that the U.S. drone strike that killed Iran’s top terrorist, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, was illegal because Washington didn’t provide enough evidence to prove that he was an imminent threat.  Her report is evidence that the U.N.’s legitimacy scam is still alive. She, like other U.N. bureaucrats believes that the U.S. can’t take any international action without the U.N.’s permission.  In early July, 53 members of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, led by Cuba, declared support for China’s imposition of a new law on Hong Kong that targets pro-democracy political action and is enforced in Hong Kong by Beijing’s own police.  On Oct. 18, the U.N. arms embargo on Iran will expire. That embargo prohibits members from selling Iran weapon systems such as ships, missiles and aircraft.  Predictably, Russia and China are opposing any extension of the embargo. When the embargo expires, they will “lend” Iran the funds to buy pretty much anything it wants, including, for example, the highly-capable Russian S-400 anti-aircraft/anti-missile system.  The only reason we need to remain a U.N. member is the veto we can exercise in the Security Council. Without it, for example, the U.N. Security Council would impose severe economic sanctions on allies such as Israel.  American conservatism doesn’t reject cooperation with other nations. But that cooperation functions best outside globalist organizations that claim control over U.S. actions and policies.  ⓒ 세상을 보는 눈,
