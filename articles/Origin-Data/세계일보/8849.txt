[WT논평] Bad doctrine made coronavirus get out of hand (1)
There is nothing wrong with doctrine. Every organization needs rules to prevent chaos. Good doctrine that is well executed gives armies, police, fire departments and other emergency response organizations a common language with which to communicate and time-honored procedures to handle recurring problems.  But not all situations have cookie-cutter solutions, and the best organizations have caveats built into training and operational philosophy to allow for individual initiative.  In tactical training, U.S. Marine Corps officers are taught doctrine, but warned that a decision in any particular case should consider the terrain and situation. The insistence on blind obedience to doctrine regardless of the circumstances is a recipe for disaster.  Blind adherence to orders and doctrine has led to countless debacles. Perhaps one of the most extreme examples came during the British Empire’s war with the Zulus when an overly officious supply sergeant refused to issue ammunition to troops while they were being overrun because they lacked a proper written requisition. The ultimate problem arises when bad doctrine becomes sacred and inviolable.  A wise old boss once told me; “always remember that doctrine is written by clowns like you and signed by fools like me.”  Perhaps the most egregious example of this was French military doctrine between the world wars. In the 1930s a French General Staff decree declared that doctrine was not to be questioned, and French battle plans were never tested in realistic war games. The real test came with live fire in 1940 when the Germans decisively discredited the doctrine and trounced the French army.  ⓒ 세상을 보는 눈,
