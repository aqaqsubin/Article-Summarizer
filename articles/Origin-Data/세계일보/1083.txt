[WT논평] France’s tradition of freedom (1)
Suppose you’re a teacher, and you’re French, and you want your students to learn about France’s tradition of freedom, the reasons your nation believes it’s good and useful to tolerate a wide range of opinions, beliefs and perspectives, including those some people find offensive.  Do you go ahead and teach this lesson? Or do you remain silent because to speak freely about freedom in France today is to risk your life?  These are not hypothetical questions. In January 2015, the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad sparked the slaughter of 12 people at the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine. After an obviously long delay, 14 alleged accomplices in that attack have recently gone on trial.  To illustrate the issues involved, Samuel Paty, a 47-year-old teacher in a Parisian suburb, on Oct. 5 showed the cartoons to those of his middle-school students who were interested - permitting anyone who preferred not to view them to step out of the classroom for a minute. On Oct. 16, Mr. Paty was attacked and beheaded.  Abdullakh Anzorov, an 18-year-old Chechen immigrant, was soon shot and killed in a confrontation with the police. French prosecutors have charged six suspects with complicity in the murder of Mr. Paty, who was married and had a 5-year-old son.  A few days later, two women and a man were attacked inside the Notre Dame Basilica in the southern French city of Nice. One of the women was “virtually beheaded” - her throat was deeply slashed - according to France’s chief anti-terrorism prosecutor.  Witnesses said the killer repeatedly shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (“God is greatest!”). Brahim al-Aouissaoui, 21, is believed to have recently arrived on a boat carrying immigrants from Tunisia.  ⓒ 세상을 보는 눈,
