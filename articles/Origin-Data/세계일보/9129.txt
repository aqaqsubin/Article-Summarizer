[WT논평] Nonproliferation requires enforcement
During the 74-year nuclear era, the world has struggled ceaselessly to find a way to keep nuclear weapons under control.  Nukes are not the ultimate evil, as some would have us believe. They’re tools, like others man has created, from dynamite to poisonous medications, which can be used for good or bad.  Consider the history of nuclear weapons. First the good side: In WWII nukes saved a million U.S. servicemen’s lives, and 10 million Japanese lives, by preventing the invasion of Japan.  The landmark Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1970 has been immensely effective in controlling proliferation of nukes. It created two tiers of states: Five nuclear weapons states and 185 non-nuclear weapons states.  The treaty, however, had one potentially fatal defect: It provided no mechanism to enforce nonproliferation.  U.S. nukes prevented WWIII for 46 years during the Cold War. America’s masterful combination of science, strategy, strength, and deterrence secured a sweeping victory against all odds.  Not a single nuke was detonated, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and communism became recognized worldwide as a failure. Nuclear weapons had prevented a catastrophe. The paramount achievement of nuclear weapons, however, has rarely been recognized.  Now what does history tell us about the bad side? It shows ? dramatically ? that nonproliferation requires enforcement.  There must be a cop on the beat. The drafters of the Nonproliferation Treaty recognized this, but they just couldn’t bite the bullet; so they went halfway and approved five nuclear-weapons states in a leadership role.  ⓒ 세상을 보는 눈,
