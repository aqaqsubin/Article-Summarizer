[WT논평] China’s red lines should be ignored (1)
President Trump is apparently of two minds about China. He wants to revive the moribund trade agreement he made with Chinese President Xi Jinping in January which, by greatly increasing China’s purchase of U.S. farm products, could increase Mr. Trump’s reelection prospects. He also wants to stand up to Chinese aggression which is destabilizing much of Asia.  The Chinese are making it perfectly clear that he cannot have it both ways. They are trying to bully him by declaring “red lines” Mr. Trump must not cross in resisting Chinese aggression.  “Red line” threats became popular in 2012, when then-President Obama warned Syria’s Bashar Assad not to cross a “red line” by using chemical weapons. Mr. Obama said that there would be “enormous consequences” if he did.  But a year later, when Mr. Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, Mr. Obama did nothing. His red line was an empty threat that diminished American credibility.  Over the past several weeks, China has been drawing red lines of its own in an attempt to limit American conduct on a host of issues. Its threats demand that if we don’t accede to their demands for appeasement, they will refuse to make the purchases of U.S. farm products provided for in the January agreement. They have already fallen far behind the deal’s goals for such purchases.  China’s aggression is being seen and felt all across Asia. Its new “security law,” just imposed on Hong Kong, makes criminal any actions undermining China’s central government and “collusion” with foreign forces, either of which can mean anything China decides those terms to mean. The new law supersedes all conflicting Hong Kong laws and will be enforced by Chinese police in Hong Kong.  ⓒ 세상을 보는 눈,
