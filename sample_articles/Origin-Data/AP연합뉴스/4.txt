European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talks during a news conference on COVID-19 vaccination plan at the EU headquarters in Brussels, Friday, Jan. 8, 2021. The European Commission said it has secured the buying of 300 million extra doses of the coronavirus Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a move that could ease criticism that the EU's executive arm has not done enough to procure coronavirus shots for the entire bloc.
